* Using GA to determine the aquifer properties
  Source code files for Sys/Hydr System Analysis term project. 

** Theis Solution
  Theis developed an analytic solution for the relationship between the drawdown and the 
  distance from the pumping well for confined aquifer. We are going to use
  that solution to find the aquifer properties. '

* How to Run the Codes:
  The Parameters are in ~config.py~ file, you can change different parameters and the observation data from that file.
  
  Run ~genetic_alg.py~ to run the main genetic algorithm, you can stop it using ~Ctrl+C~ in the terminal.

  Run ~visualize.py~ to make the animation of solution, it'll save a gif with name ~anim.gif~ in the current folder.

  There are some codes in the plot directory for plotting the results. Some are in ~gnuplot~ some are in ~R~, you can use that, or make your own plots from the data saved in ~data/models.csv~ which contains the results from ~3125~ simulations run during parameter tuning.

* Results
  Main results can be seen in the [[./final_docs/presentation.pdf]]
